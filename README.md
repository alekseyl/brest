- [ ] Multiple schemas aka versions
- [ ] Multiple ORM adapters.
   - [ ] Separate ActiveRecord adapter from preparation stuff
   - [ ] Introduce sequel adapter 
   - [ ] Move activerecord to dev_dependencies and add check on any of supported ORMs presence 
- [ ] Allow nested selections in included model.
- [ ] Cover with test all extensions related to synthetic attributes, jsonb models e.t.c. 
- [ ] Better api definitions helpers ( in body params + allowing schema to be mentioned in parameter function, right now its a pretty messed up with the blank names params e.t.c. )
- [ ] Examine schema with validators and ensure no swagger-ui hacks are used anymore, swagger UI is a messed up outdated thingy, use Postman instead.
