# B(etter)REST
Ð¡ybersquatting the name for a brest ( better REST ) gem.

## Installation

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

    $ bundle add brest

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

    $ gem install brest

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

## TODO

- [ ] Major improvements
  - [ ] Proper naming ( basic method should be renamed from _sw suffixed methods, that is kinda sloppy )
  - [x] Allow nested selections in included model.
  - [ ] Extract nested selection as standalone gem
  - [ ] Named pkeys ( currently :id is assumed and added all over the code :( ) 
  - [ ] Multiple schemas aka versions
  - [ ] Multiple ORM adapters.
    - [ ] Separate ActiveRecord adapter from preparation stuff
    - [ ] Introduce sequel adapter
    - [ ] Move activerecord to dev_dependencies and add check on any of supported ORMs presence
- [ ] DSL improvements
  - [ ] attrs enhancement ( currently jsonb/synthetic attribute naming stored 
          globally and hence might break when there is naming collision, see jsonb_attributes method ) 
  - [ ] Full DSL description with a example models relations
  - [ ] ActiveStorage helpers for preloading
  - [ ] inject_schema helper ( as a replacement for injectable attrs )
  - [x] Replace '$ref' => :Model, with type: :Model
  - [ ] Better api definitions helpers ( in body params + allowing schema to be mentioned in parameter function, right now its a pretty messed up with the blank names params e.t.c. )
- [ ] Issues
  - [x] jsonb does not work without store model!
- [ ] Test coverage improvements (Cover with test all extensions related to synthetic attributes, jsonb models e.t.c.)
  - [x] Rethink data structures and relations
  - [ ] nested attributes models
  - [x] jsonb
  - [x] includes_sw
  - [ ] injectable attributes
  - [x] select_sw
  - [ ] select_sw nested
  - [ ] synthetic attributes
  - [x] property extended definition without '$ref'
- [ ] Examine schema with validators and ensure no swagger-ui hacks are used anymore, swagger UI is a messed up outdated thingy, use Postman instead.

## Nested Select patch

### How preloading happens in rails and when is the best time to interfere

**Preloading** is a part of activerecord which tends to change pretty often.
Practically all major releases interfere preloader code, the current implementation was introduced starting rails 7.0 version.
But if you get the idea of current implementation, you can traverse the earlier state and get the idea how to make them work with nested select:
Regardless of the major rails version and implementation, you will end up patching the `build_scope` method of
`ActiveRecord::Associations::Preloader::Association`!

So you just need to define a way to deliver select_values to instance of `ActiveRecord::Associations::Preloader::Association`

### How preloading happens in rails >= 7.0
To be honest ( and opinionated :) ), current preloading implementation is a kinda mess, and we need to adapt to this mess without delivering some more.

Let's look at the scopes example:
```ruby
# user <-habtm-> bought_items
# user -> has_one -> user_profile -> has_many -> avatars
User.includes( :bought_items, user_profile: :avatars)
```

Preloading will create instances `Preloader` objects for:
- each isolated preloading `Branch` which started from the root, in this case: `:bought_items` and `user_profile: :avatars`
- each trough relation inside preloading tree, including hidden ones like habtm relation does. 

Each `Preloader` object building it's own preloader tree from a set of `Branch` objects.
In a given case it might roughly look like this: 
```
Preloader(:bought_items) -> Branch(:root) 
                              \__ Branch(:bought_items) -> Preloader::ThroughAssociation(:bought_items)
                              
Preloader(user_profile: :avatars) -> Branch(:root) 
                                        \__ Branch(:user_profile) -> Preloader::Association(:user_profile)
                                              \__Branch(:avatars) -> Preloader::Association(:avatars)                          
```

Each `Branch` will create a set of loaders objects of `Preloader::Association` or `Preloader::ThroughAssociation`
Then running all of them will preload nested records and establish a connections between records. 

To be able to select limited attributes sets, we need to deliver them to `Association` level objects, and patch `build_scope` method with it.

**_Rem:_** Each `Preloader::ThroughAssociation` object creates it's own `Preloader` and starts additional 'isolated' preloading process. 

So implementation adds a `nested_select_values` attributes into instances of `Preloader`, `Branch`, `Association` hierarchy and some methods to populate corresponding select_values over the tree.
